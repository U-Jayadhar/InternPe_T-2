# InternPe_T-2

## Assignment-2 of AI-ML Internship at InternPe

_Make a Car Price Predictor with ML_

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the prices of cars based on various features. The steps involved include data cleaning, data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in the file `quikr_car.csv`. This dataset includes several features related to car specifications and their prices.

## Project Structure

- `quikr_car.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `car_price.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/U-Jayadhar/InternPe_T-2.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd InternPe_T-2
   ```

## Model Building Steps

1. **Load the Data**: Read the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and incorrect data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize numerical features and encode categorical features.
4. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest Regressor model to predict car prices.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score.

## Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- R^2 Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.


## Results

The results of the model evaluation are printed at the end of the Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score.
